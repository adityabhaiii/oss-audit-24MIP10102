🐍 Open Source Audit Project
👤 Student Information
Name: Aditya Singh Registration Number: 24MIP10102 Course: Open Source Software (OSS NGMC)

💻 Chosen Software: Python
Python is an open-source, high-level programming language known for its simplicity, readability, and wide range of applications. It is widely used in web development, data science, artificial intelligence, automation, and system scripting.

This project focuses on analyzing Python from both a theoretical and practical perspective, including its origin, licensing, ecosystem, and real-world usage on Linux systems.

📜 Project Overview
This repository contains five shell scripts developed as part of the Open Source Audit project. These scripts demonstrate practical Linux skills and automation using Bash scripting.

Each script is designed to showcase key concepts such as system information retrieval, package inspection, file system analysis, log processing, and user interaction.

⚙️ Scripts Description
🔹 Script 1 — System Identity Report
This script displays important details about the Linux system, including:

Kernel version
Logged-in user
Home directory
System uptime
Current date and time
Linux distribution
It provides a quick overview of the system environment.

🔹 Script 2 — FOSS Package Inspector
This script checks whether Python is installed on the system. It:

Verifies package availability
Displays version details
Uses conditional statements to handle installation status
🔹 Script 3 — Disk and Permission Auditor
This script analyzes key system directories such as /etc, /home, and /var/log. It:

Displays directory size
Shows ownership and permissions
Helps understand Linux file system structure
🔹 Script 4 — Log File Analyzer
This script reads system log files and:

Counts occurrences of keywords (e.g., "error")
Displays recent matching entries
Helps in basic system monitoring and debugging
🔹 Script 5 — Open Source Manifesto Generator
This interactive script:

Takes user input
Generates a personalized open-source philosophy statement
Saves the output into a text file
▶️ How to Run the Scripts
Step 1: Give execution permission
chmod +x script*.sh
Step 2: Run scripts
./script1.sh
./script2.sh
./script3.sh
./script4.sh /var/log/syslog
# or
./script4.sh /var/log/messages
./script5.sh
🖥️ System Requirements
Linux Operating System (Ubuntu recommended)
Bash Shell
Basic terminal knowledge
🧠 Learning Outcomes
Through this project, I gained:

Understanding of open-source philosophy and licensing
Hands-on experience with Linux command-line tools
Knowledge of Bash scripting concepts
Insight into how open-source software operates in real systems
📌 Conclusion
This project demonstrates both theoretical understanding and practical implementation of open-source concepts using Python and Linux. It highlights the importance of collaboration, transparency, and automation in modern software development.

⭐ This repository is part of an academic project submission. This project was implemented and tested on Ubuntu 22.04 (WSL environment).
